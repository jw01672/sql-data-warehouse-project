# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse Project  
*A complete end‑to‑end data warehousing pipeline built using the Bronze–Silver–Gold architecture.*

## ⭐ Overview  
This project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and document a full data‑warehouse solution — from raw data ingestion to analytical data models. It showcases practical skills in:

- Data modeling (Star Schema)
- ETL/ELT pipeline development
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Data integration across multiple source systems (CRM + ERP)
- Documentation and data cataloging
- SQL‑based analytics and reporting

This repository is structured and documented as if it were part of a professional analytics engineering workflow.

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary  
The project follows the **Medallion Architecture**:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Bronze** | Raw ingestion of CRM & ERP datasets exactly as received |
| **Silver** | Cleaning, standardization, deduplication, and integration |
| **Gold** | Star schema for analytics (facts & dimensions) |
